# About this document

As mentioned in the introduction section; there are many brands of relational database, enterprise and open source. However; as per the document title this document will cover the basics of [T-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-2017) Transact Structured Query Language or T-SQL

> ## What is T-SQL?

T-SQL is Microsoft’s implementation of SQL in their proprietary brand of RDBMS called Microsoft SQL Server. [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/installation-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017) is an enterprise RDBMS, I don’t need enterprise RDBMS to learn the basics.

And you indeed do not need it, Microsoft have a scaled down version of the mighty enterprise version specifically for learning T-SQL in a Microsoft environment called Microsoft SQL Server Express, MS SQL Express.

This version may also be used to implement applications that do not require enterprise scaling. The next section Getting Started will point you to the resources you need to acquire the software as well as instructions on installation thereof.

> ## What are “The Basics”?

The great thing about SQL is that knowing the basics can go a long way.

For instance, say you are a data analyst that uses excel to analyse and maintain data. Excel is a great tool and works very well for creating reports, but although it can in theory handle 1 million plus a bit records. Anything above 200 000 and it will just be a frustration to use.

The content of this document will place you in a position to administer data using the power of **Microsoft’s Database engine** without having to acquire an expensive more efficient alternative to Excel.

> ## What is covered in this document?

Even though the basics can take you a long way, the road to learning advanced SQL is even longer as it covers multiple disciplines like distributed database administration, database design and implementation, database security etc.

If you are a software developer, solutions architect or database administrator and you already know some SQL; this document is unfortunately not appropriate for you. Feel free to go to the Advanced topics section of this page which might guide you toward the appropriate material.

If you are brand new to RDBMS and you wish to get certified, there is a link to the Microsoft Virtual Academy in the Additional resources section of this document.
