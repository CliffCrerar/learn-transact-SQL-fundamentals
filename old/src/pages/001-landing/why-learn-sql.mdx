### About the Author:

<AboutAuthor callBadge={false}/>

### Motivation

If you visit the git where the source files for this site is stored you will read that I started this as a education project, while completing the project I realized that I had met all the rubric points yet I still felt it was not complete, Working at a company where not everyone is a software developer but the core products are related to data analytics which require our software to intergrate with any data source, and mostly SQL systems I regularly get questions regarding this. Thus I decided that if I can serve the community using my God given talents I am going to do so. At the point of writing this the document is fairly new and is an ongoing affair, I will knock of these topics are publication additions as I go along.
