# Introduction

Structured query language ([SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)) is a [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) used to program, design and administer relational-database-management systems. The language is used by many types of users including software developers, database administrators, consultants implementing external software that must integrate with operational and financial business systems. In this tech age there are even users in other functions of business like finance and procurement that prefer to interact directly with their data instead of opting to use a front end application. It can also be a powerful tool in the hands of an internal auditor.

## Relational Databases

[Relational-database-management systems (RDBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system), also known as **Relational Databases**, are the industry standard data repositories used by most business systems, large and small, that must store day to day transactions generated under normal operating conditions. These types of database are also referred to as [online transaction processing or OLTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing). 

These **OLTP** database are optimized to process many single or small batches of transaction, even when the database is distributed across multiple regions or even globally while always maintaining consistency of data.

The other general type of **RDBMS** is [online analytical processing or OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) database. This type of database is optimized to process vast amounts of transactions normally generated by an **OLTP** database, and **OLTP** is normally the source of an **OLAP**    repository. 

**OLAP** is mainly for generating information to support management decision making in all business functions and at all levels of management.

There are many variations of RDBMS, open-source and enterprise. Most notable enterprise RDBMS is [Oracle database](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and [Microsoft SQL server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-2017). [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) are most notable open-source RDBMS

## SQL Sub-languages

SQL is a language that is based on [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) and [tuple calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_relational_calculus). It consists of a subset of languages and are listed as follows:


    Data Query Language (DQL)
    Data Definition Language (DDL)
    Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    Data Transaction Language (DTL)
    Data Control Language (DCL)

> ** __NOTE__ that these subsets are only covered briefly in this sections and will be discussed with the help of examples in their own sections of this document.**

### ***Data Query Language***
<div className="sql-sub">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Used for data retrieval used for display in application or in a database client.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### ***Data Definition Language***
<div className="sql-sub">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Is used to define the database and is used to implement database objects such as tables, columns, relationships and constraints.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### ***Data Transaction Language*** 
<div className="sql-sub">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Used to control the way the database processes transactions, also sometimes referred to as  <i>Transaction Control Language (TCL)</i>, is used to group DML statements into logically executed groups.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### ***Data Manipulation Language***
<div className="sql-sub">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Used to create data initiated by business transactions as well as updating or deleting data, DML is also used to alter database objects such modifying tables or t1-columns. to implement database objects such as tables, columns, relationships and constraints. DML is used to create data initiated by business transactions as well as updating or deleting data, DML is also used to alter database objects such modifying tables or columns.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### ***Data Control Language***
<div className="sql-sub">
    <ul>
        <li>
        DCL is the subset of SQL that an administrator must know to control access to the database, control user permissions and define new users programmatically. Although in the modern era these are best control and maintained through the database client.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

> SQL can also be described as a [declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) (4GL) language and includes some elements of a [procedural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming).
