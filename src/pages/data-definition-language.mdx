# Data definition language

*Data definition language* or `DDL` is a sub section of Structured Query Language that is responsible for creating data structures and the database [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema). It is used to `CREATE`, `ALTER` or `MODIFY` and `DROP` the database objects such as tables, columns indexes and constraints etc.

Each of these actions or commands also have their own set of modifiers to use depending on the object that is used. In the previous sections we looked at each of the different commands that fall under that umbrella. However for this section we will look a types of objects and how to `CREATE`, `ALTER` or `MODIFY` and how to drop them using the `Northwind` database.
