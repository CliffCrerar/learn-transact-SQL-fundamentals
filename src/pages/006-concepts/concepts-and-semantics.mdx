# Concepts and Semantics

The purpose of is to briefly familiarize yourself with some of the **database jargon** that is used when talking about SQL and databases, and are usually the terms used by database designers. For example, when we normally speak about data in a tabular form, like the data stored in excel we usually refer to fields and records. Fields being the columns and records being the rows. Also in this section we will very briefly discuss how databases are modelled using business cases or use cases. The table below shows the terms that professionals use when discussing topics related to data, databases, database servers and Structured query language.

#### ***So you probably thinking right now, "I thought we were going to start writing SQL". And we definitively are, first however there is a bit of theory that must be covered so that when we start coding we have a good understanding about the code we are writing.***

## Data modelling and table Relationships

These technique described here will be a basic demonstration of how the relational model is conceptualized. Data modelling is an advanced topic of database design but it will be discussed briefly, for the purpose of an understanding of how relationships are formed between tables. These type of relationships are important to understand for [Joining tables](http://www.learn-transact-sql.tk/#Joining_tables).

### *There are 3 main types of table relationships:

    1 to 1 / one to one
    1 to many / one to many / 1 to *
    many to many / * to *

> There is also a 4th type of relationship, it is the recursive relationship and the reason it is not part of the main 3 is because these 3 are usually between different tables and the recursive relationship occurs when a table has a relationship with itself in a kind of parent child configuration.

These relationships might seem simple but they also have a more advanced aspect when considering the concept of participation, furthermore complicated by sheer number. Usually in theory only a few tables are required to explain certain concepts. Enterprise systems can have hundreds of tables in only one schema like accounts payable, and the total number of tables in an enterprise system very easily have thousands of tables each with a relationship with hundreds of other tables. This problem is not relevant to our discussion though.

## Modelling data from a User story

In almost all cases, the theory of data modeling will start with a user story as the main objective of data modelling is to convert business rules into a data structure which will now be demonstrated.

Stricter terms would merely call these requirements, but I have chosen, from a purely bias perspective to use the [Agile Methodology](https://luis-goncalves.com/what-is-agile-methodology/) term of user story as opposed to requirements.

<UserStory/>

User stories like this one, are what set the requirements for a data structure. But how do you create a data structure from the above?

Without diving too deep looking at the above a data designer will consider the following as a technique to extract the requirements from the story.

>### 1. **Nouns translate into tables or entities.** 
>### 2. **Characteristics or attributes translate into columns.**
>### 3. **Actions or interactions between the entities define the relationships.**

## Interpreting requirements

### 1. ENTITIES (tables)

Entities can be a person, object, document almost anything that exists in the real world. Like an employee, student, class, job card, car, an invoice, an a single entry on a purchase order, a building or company. Anything that can be intangible and in some cases intangible, the main point is that identifying these entities are the first step in interpreting requirements.
  
### 2. ATTRIBUTES (columns)

These are identified after entities have been identified because these are the characteristics of the entities that have been identified. For example an employee has a name, surname, employee number date of birth. Invoices have invoice numbers, issue dates, item entries. Students have student numbers, are enrolled for classes and receive grades. 

> It is important to note that from the above examples, in the case of students and classes and invoices and invoice entries. It is clear that in some instances entities can also be attributes, it is not always as clear cut and data designers have to consider these carefully to make sure they are modelled correctly.

### 3. PARTICIPATION (relationships)

Relationships are identified by, after identifying the entities and their attributes, considering how entities interact or participate with each other. Part of this step is also to define the type of relationship the entities have with one another. (one to one, one to many, many to many)

#### ***We are going to start coding soon, don't worry, lets first take a little bit of time to lay a good foundation.***

## Design the date from the requirements

### 1 - A used car sales business named 123 Sold (pty) ltd, has many departments.
Sales business and departments are the entities, Company and Departments.
Company has an attribute of name, and we can assume that departments would have a name as well.
Has many indicates the interaction and if you have experience working you will know that a company has many departments.
From this we can model this business case:

![img - 1 to many relationship example](https://cdn-learnsql.c1i44.now.sh/pg6/r_one_to_many.png)
> ### **one to many relationship**

So this is what a data structure would look like for this business case. It is a 1 to many relationship because a company can have many departments but a department can only belong to 1 company.

In the image above, ct1-rows foot notation was used for modeling the business case. To find out more for about erd modelling notation [follow this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model).

### 2 - Each department is managed by one person, this person appointed as manager can only be in charge of one department.
Entities are manager and department.
Once again the assumption is made that department and manager has a name.
And the interaction is a 1 to 1 relationship.
From this we can model this business case:

![img - 1 to 1 relationship example](https://cdn-learnsql.c1i44.now.sh/pg6/r_one_to_one.png)
> ### **one to one relationship**        

This business case is a 1 to 1 relationship between.

### 3 - In the sales department, a salesman can advertise and market any car. Any car may also be advertised and marketed by any salesman.
The entities are salesman and car.
Although sales department is mentioned, this will just be to link to the department entity modeled above, but we will not model this just yet.
The interaction is a salesmen can market any car and any car can be marketed by any salesman.
This is a many to many relationship:

![img - many to many relationship](https://cdn-learnsql.c1i44.now.sh/pg6/r_many_to_many.png)
> ### **many to many relationship**


You can see that the ct1-rows foot is on both sides. Although we are able to model a many to many relationship, physically implementing implementing a many to many relationship is not a good idea. Many to many relationships are mostly theoretical and should be avoided.

To diffuse this situation implementing a [composite entity](http://databasemanagement.wikia.com/wiki/Database_Entities_in_E/R_Modeling) is usually the order of the day as below:

![img - composite entity](https://cdn-learnsql.c1i44.now.sh/pg6/r_composite.png)
> ### **composite entity**

    
By creating the composite entity Advertisements the many to many relationship is resolved and it is possible to know exactly which salesmen placed what add and for which cars adds have been placed.

### 4 - A car always will have a base t1-color, but it's panels can be painted in different t1-colors.
There are various ways to model this problem, but the aim here is to demonstrate a [recursive relationship](https://www.sqa.org.uk/e-learning/SoftDevRDS02CD/page_49.htm).

There is only 1 entity, t1-color. But will include, the car entity for this example.

![img - recursive relationship](https://cdn-learnsql.c1i44.now.sh/pg6/r_recursive.png)
> ### **recursive relationship**


Instead of trying to capture each panel as a t1-column in Car, which is not a good idea to start off with because each car would not have the same number of panels. How would you know how many t1-columns to create and furthermore what to name the t1-columns as each car might not have the same type of panels.

With this design each panel can be named assigned to a car, a car can be assigned with as many panels as reburied and the solution is not an architectural conundrum.

But the point here is that you can see that the t1-color table has a relationship with itself. This is what is known as a recursive relationship. The requirement states that a car must have a base t1-color and then all other panel t1-colors must be linked to this base t1-color.

hence for a specific car, it would have a base t1-color, and all the panels that are related to that car would be children of this base t1-color.

From this we can also see that a fair amount of assumption is also required when doing data modeling.

Database designers are highly trained and experienced professionals, and are in tune with what is required by a client. All applications start here.
